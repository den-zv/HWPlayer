# HWPlayer

## Preconditions
* Xcode 15.2
* Colors and fonts can differ from ones on screenshot due to an absence of proper resources
* System images are used instead of real ones due to an absence of proper resources
* For selected book's keynotes sounds are generated by AI and sound files are placed in the bundle
* Hard-coded in-memory storage used for book and keynotes

## Points of improvement
Listing of points that can be done to make an app better but was omitted due to a lack of time.
* There are no tests for now
* Keynote list screen is just a stub instead of proper list with selectable keynotes
* SwiftLint isn't configured within the project
* Currently there is no separate entry point for resources usage (strings are not localized, colors are hardcoded, system images are not separated into one place, no R.swift/SwiftGen usage)
* There are no separate packages (or targets) for app layers (e. g. Dependencies, Views, Entities, etc.), all files are in the main target for now
* There is no error handler when book info can't be loaded for now (but player related errors are handled correctly)
